## What is Erela.js?

Erela.js is a Lavalink client I made after seeing how others are used, most are bare bones and require the user to add much more complicated code.

Erela.js is designed to be as easy to use and offer as many features as possible including easy to read documentation, easy overall usage, many events to listen to, extendable classes and plugins.
